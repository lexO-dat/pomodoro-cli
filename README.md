```bash
make build      # Build the application
make clean      # Clean build artifacts
make test       # Run tests
make deps       # Download dependencies
make install    # Install (requires sudo)
make uninstall  # Uninstall from system (requires sudo)
make run        # Build and run locally
make run-custom # Build and run with custom timing

```

### Running Locally
```bash
# Run with default settings
make run

make run-custom

# Or build and run manually
make build
./bin/pomodoro -w 25 -b 5
```

## How It Works

1. **Timer starts** with a full green progress bar
2. **Bar gradually turns red** as time runs out
3. **Sound notification** plays when session completes
4. **Automatically switches** between work and break sessions
5. **Press R** to reset back to work session anytime

## Platform Support

- **Linux** - Tries paplay, aplay, or speaker-test
- **Other** - Terminal bell character fallback

## Requirements

- Go 1.21 or later
- Terminal with color support
- For sound: System audio capabilities
